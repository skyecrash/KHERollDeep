The framework for my potential application StudyWatch (project file created before name).

StudyWatch is a potential application to track the availability of study rooms in The University of Akron's Bierce Library.
This is the React-Native framework, with static data input to create a potential appearance. 
The colors for the design of this app were chosen with color-blindness in mind, so it is easily navigable by those who cannot see the typical
red-green indicator colors.
Please note that running the app in debug mode on a physical device may not load images, most likely due to a bundling issue.
However, emulated devices do not seem to have the same issue.

Please see the visual-elements branch for logo design and screen stills.

(Visual elements were created by Tammie Nguyen.)
